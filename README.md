# ML-for-carbon-capture-determination

Using classic ML regression algorithms along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the solubility of CO2 in deep eutectic solvents (DES) was derived over multiple pressure and temperature ranges, as a function of molecular and thermodynamic parameters.
Research paper to be published soon.
